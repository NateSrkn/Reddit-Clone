# Bloccit: a Reddit replica using Rails.

Bloccit was created to test the power of Rails.
Throughout this project, I kept wanting to add more and more features.


## Features
<ul>
  <li>Sign in and sign up.</li>
  <li>Create topics, posts, comments.</li>
  <li>Check other users pages to see what they've posted, commented and favorited.</li>
  <li>When a user favorites a post they will receive an email when a new user comments on the post.</li>
</ul>

## See it live
