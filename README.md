# A reddit clone built using Rails

This project was created to test the power of Rails.
Throughout this project, I kept wanting to add more and more features.


## Features
<ul>
  <li>Sign in and sign up.</li>
  <li>Create topics, posts, comments.</li>
  <li>Check other users pages to see what they've posted, commented and favorited.</li>
  <li>When a user favorites a post they will receive an email when a new user comments on the post.</li>
</ul>

## Clone it and get it running

  `git clone https://github.com/NateSrkn/bloccit.git`
  
  ### Run it locally
  
  `rails s`
  
  ### Check the console
 
 `rails c`

## See it live
